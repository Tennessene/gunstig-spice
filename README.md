# Günstig SPICE

Günstig SPICE is a Java [SPICE](https://www.spice-space.org/) client library.

Günstig SPICE is a Java library, but it isn't a pure Java library. It utilizes the existing spice-gtk library with JNI to be able to manage the SPICE client. While it is possible to port the whole spice-gtk library to Java, that will be left for the future.
